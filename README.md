## Spelunky Classic HD
A game by [Derek Yu](http://www.mossmouth.com/)

Ported from **GameMaker 8.1** to **GameMaker Studio** by [Darius Kazemi](http://tinysubversions.com/2012/07/spelunky-html5/) and [YoYo Games](https://www.yoyogames.com/) (as far as I can tell).

Source code was published in **Humble Weekly Bundle: Play and Create with GameMaker**.
According to [Spelunky User License](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD/blob/master/help.rtf) it's totally legal to distribute source code and binaries. If I'm wrong let me know.

## Things I have implemented:
- Support for different aspect ratios (originally 4:3 only)
- Touch input support (mobile devices)
- Support for [translations](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDTranslations)
- Russian translation

Also I provide builds for [Android, Linux and Windows](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD/releases/latest)

## Bugs
There was quite a few bugs and missing features in source code from Humble Bundle and maybe I've added few more. 
At least one bug was game breaking (impossibility to start final fight). I've partically fixed it and game now completable, but [help is welcome](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD/issues/1)
